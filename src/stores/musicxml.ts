 * The optional location attribute indicates where a key

 * and to the left. It is left by default. For mid-measure key
 * elements, a cancel location of before-barline should be
 * treated like a cancel location of left.
 * 
 * Non-traditional key signatures can be represented using
 * the Humdrum/Scot concept of a list of altered tones.
 * The key-step and key-alter elements are represented the

 * element in the note.mod file. The optional key-accidental
 * element is represented the same way as the accidental

 * The content specifies the octave value using the same

 * Text underlays for lyrics, based on Humdrum with support
 * for other formats. The lyric number indicates multiple
 * lines, though a name can be used as well (as in Finale's
 * verse/chorus/section specification). Word extensions are
 * represented using the extend element. Hyphenation is
 * indicated by the syllabic element, which can be single,
 * begin, end, or middle. These represent single-syllable
 * words, word-beginning syllables, word-ending syllables,
 * and mid-word syllables. Multiple syllables on a single
 * note are separated by elision elements. A hyphen in the
 * text element should only be used for an actual hyphenated
 * word. Two text elements that are not separated by an
 * elision element are part of the same syllable, but may have
 * different text formatting.
 * 
 * Humming and laughing representations are taken from
 * Humdrum. The end-line and end-paragraph elements come
 * from RP-017 for Standard MIDI File Lyric meta-events;
 * they help facilitate lyric display for Karaoke and
 * similar applications. Language names for text elements
 * come from ISO 639, with optional country subcodes from
 * ISO 3166. Justification is center by default; placement is
 * below by default. The print-object attribute can override
 * a note's print-lyric attribute in cases where only some
 * lyrics on a note are printed, as when lyrics for later verses
 * are printed in a block of text rather than with each note.

 * can then add, subtract, or alter from these
 * starting points. Values include:
 * 
 * Triads:
 * major (major third, perfect fifth)
 * minor (minor third, perfect fifth)
 * augmented (major third, augmented fifth)
 * diminished (minor third, diminished fifth)
 * Sevenths:
 * dominant (major triad, minor seventh)
 * major-seventh (major triad, major seventh)
 * minor-seventh (minor triad, minor seventh)
 * diminished-seventh
 *     (diminished triad, diminished seventh)
 * augmented-seventh
 *     (augmented triad, minor seventh)
 * half-diminished
 *     (diminished triad, minor seventh)
 * major-minor
 *     (minor triad, major seventh)
 * Sixths:
 * major-sixth (major triad, added sixth)
 * minor-sixth (minor triad, added sixth)
 * Ninths:
 * dominant-ninth (dominant-seventh, major ninth)
 * major-ninth (major-seventh, major ninth)
 * minor-ninth (minor-seventh, major ninth)
 * 11ths (usually as the basis for alteration):
 * dominant-11th (dominant-ninth, perfect 11th)
 * major-11th (major-ninth, perfect 11th)
 * minor-11th (minor-ninth, perfect 11th)
 * 13ths (usually as the basis for alteration):
 * dominant-13th (dominant-11th, major 13th)
 * major-13th (major-11th, major 13th)
 * minor-13th (minor-11th, major 13th)
 * Suspended:
 * suspended-second (major second, perfect fifth)
 * suspended-fourth (perfect fourth, perfect fifth)
 * Functional sixths:
 * Neapolitan
 * Italian
 * French
 * German
 * Other:
 * pedal (pedal-point bass)
 * power (perfect fifth)
 * Tristan
 * 
 * The "other" kind is used when the harmony is entirely
 * composed of add elements. The "none" kind is used to
 * explicitly encode absence of chords or functional
 * harmony.
 * 
 * The attributes are used to indicate the formatting
 * of the symbol. Since the kind element is the constant
 * in all the harmony-chord entities that can make up
 * a polychord, many formatting attributes are here.
 * 
 * The use-symbols attribute is yes if the kind should be
 * represented when possible with harmony symbols rather
 * than letters and numbers. These symbols include:
 * 
 * major: a triangle, like Unicode 25B3
 * minor: -, like Unicode 002D
 * augmented: +, like Unicode 002B
 * diminished: °, like Unicode 00B0
 * half-diminished: ø, like Unicode 00F8
 * 
 * For the major-minor kind, only the minor symbol is used when
 * use-symbols is yes. The major symbol is set using the symbol
 * attribute in the degree-value element. The corresponding
 * degree-alter value will usually be 0 in this case.
 * 
 * The text attribute describes how the kind should be spelled
 * in a score. If use-symbols is yes, the value of the text
 * attribute follows the symbol. The stack-degrees attribute
 * is yes if the degree elements should be stacked above each
 * other. The parentheses-degrees attribute is yes if all the
 * degrees should be in parentheses. The bracket-degrees
 * attribute is yes if all the degrees should be in a bracket.
 * If not specified, these values are implementation-specific.
 * The alignment attributes are for the entire harmony-chord
 * entity of which this kind element is a part.
